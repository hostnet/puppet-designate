    A new ``designate::coordination`` class has been added to facilitate
    setting cordinate/backend_url configuration for multiple designate
    components. Please use the ``designate::coordination::backend_url``
    parameter instead of ``designate::producer::backend_url`` when
    using the new dedicated class.
